## Functionality
### Messenger 2019 Journey
A overview of simple data visualizations and numbers for the user's use of Messenger in the year of 2019.
Click 'Load' and load in the directory of downloaded data.
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard or the clickable arrows on the left side to navigate.

### Data Dashboard
Provides more comprehensive data by two parameters: the *contact* and a *date range*.
- Leaving the contact blank would do a data query for all contacts comparison to the user.
- Leaving the date range blank would search for the entire chat history for the contact.
- Leaving both blank would get the default page: the history of all contacts of the user's entire history on messenger.
